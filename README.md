# VendPiece
 
VenPiece is a web application for order management and product deliveries . 
Developed by angular7 in frontend and nodeJs in the backend . 
I used express the nodeJs framework in the backend . 
you will have to install these packages : 
-     "sequelize
-    "express"
-    "chart.js"
-     "cors"
-    "jsonwebtoken"
-    "bcrypt"
-    "body-parser"
-    "bootstrap"

I used the RDBMS  mysql the file Database/db.js make the connection to the database . 
to run the backend you tap :  npm start 
same thing to the frontend . 
then go to http://localhost:4200

# VendPiece
 
VenPiece is a web application for order management and product deliveries . 
Developed by angular7 in frontend and nodeJs in the backend . 
I used express the nodeJs framework in the backend . 
you will have to install these packages : 

-     "sequelize": "^4.42.0"
-    "express": "^4.16.4"
-    "chart.js": "^2.7.3"
-     "cors": "^2.8.5"
-    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.4.0"
-    "bcrypt": "^3.0.2",
-    "body-parser": "^1.18.3"
-    "bootstrap": "^4.2.1"


I used the RDBMS  mysql the file Database/db.js make the connection to the database . 
to run the backend you tap :  npm start 
same thing to the frontend . 
then go to http://localhost:4200
